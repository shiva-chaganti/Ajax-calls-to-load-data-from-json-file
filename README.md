1. I have used Node.js as the server framework as it is very flexible for building web applications and has very simple syntaxes to understand.

2. I have used Jquery as the client framework which was helpful to make ajax calls to the server and load the json data to the webpage.

3. Node.js with a rich collection of library functions made easy to host the server.

4. Making Ajax calls to the server using jQuery was a tricky task and took sometime. However, I have to learn so many things from that.

5. I have used express framework with node.js. This helped me for easy routing.

6. List of commands:
	
	
	# git add .
	# git commit -m "comment"
	# git push heroku master
